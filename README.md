# Maze-Solver
A simple python maze generator and solver

Needs a lot of clean up, but is functional. Changes to some of the parameters in main should be okay.

Uses https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Randomized_Prim's_algorithm for maze generation

Uses a depth-first search for solving
